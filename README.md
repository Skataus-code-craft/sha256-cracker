# sha256-cracker
## OUR first `c#` programme
### We are currently learning `C#` and other C-like languages like `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, etc.
### We made a very simple SHA256 cracker at day 1 as our first `C#` programme.
#### This is just part of the practice so the code isn't efficient or has a good quality.
